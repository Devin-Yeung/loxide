## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the following open-source projects or resource,
without which this project wouldn't have been possible:

- The book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), and
  it's [source code](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters),
  which is a great tutorial for beginner to build your own programming language, and it's how this project starts.

- [Christian Briones](https://github.com/cwbriones)'s [implementation](https://github.com/cwbriones/rlox/tree/master).
  I learnt a lot from his work, and I've incorporated some of his approaches into this project.
